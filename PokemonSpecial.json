  "description": "Pokémon Adventures (Japanese: ポケットモンスターSPECIAL Pocket Monsters SPECIAL) is a manga series authored by 日下秀憲 Hidenori Kusaka. It was illustrated by 真斗 Mato for the first nine volumes and starting from Volume 10 it has been illustrated by 山本サトシ Satoshi Yamamoto. It is published by Shogakukan under the Ladybird Comics Special series. It debuted in Japan on March 3rd, 1997.\n\nIt is popularly known as Pokémon Special even outside of Japan, and often shortened as PokéSpe (Japanese: ポケスペ / ポケSP PokeSupe).\n\nUnlike the anime—which, though drawing much inspiration from the games, does not follow them exactly—Pokémon Adventures is a mostly game-based manga, with the twenty-three main characters taking their names from the core series games and their various adventures tending to stay restricted to their home region. Also unlike the anime, which has gone to great lengths to indicate the danger of a Legendary or Mythical Pokémon being captured, the main characters of Pokémon Adventures have captured and sometimes use their own legends, much as the player can in the games. Pokémon Adventures also contains darker elements than other media, including certain characters and some Pokémon actually dying.\n\nPokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri has endorsed the series, stating \"This is the comic that most resembles the world I was trying to convey.\"[3] Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president and CEO of The Pokémon Company and Pokémon producer, has also praised the series, saying, \"I want every Pokémon fan to read this comic!\"[4]",
